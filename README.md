# RARS-JS

# WARNING development ongoing

This is a fork of the [RARS editor](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars). 


It has been made to decouple the UI from the core simulator.

The repository is split into two parts:
- `rars` Which contains the core simulator and class interfaces to implement IO.
- `rarsjs` A Typescript library that compiles the simulator to JavaScript and provides a simple interface to interact with it.
